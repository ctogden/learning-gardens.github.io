      Our Mission<br><br>

      It is difficult to carve out time for focused study. We support learning groups in any discipline to overcome this inertia and build their own lessons, community, and learning styles. If we succeed in our mission, participating groups should feel empowered while free of institutional shackles.<br><br>

      Community-based learning — free, with friends, using public resources — is simply a more sustainable and distributed form of learning for the 21st century. Peer-oriented and interest-driven study often fosters the best learning anyway.<br><br>

      Learning Gardens is an internet-native organization. As such, we seek to embrace transparency, decentralization, and multiple access points. <br><br>
