      Organization<br><br>

      We currently use <a class="link dim green" href="https://learning-gardens.slack.com/" target="_blank">Slack</a> to communicate and <a class="link dim green" href="https://github.com/learning-gardens" target="_blank">Github</a> to build learning resources. We're avid users of <a class="link dim green" href="https://www.are.na/" target="_blank">Are.na</a>, which we use to find and collect research materials. In a way, Learning Gardens was born from this network. You're welcome to <a class="link dim green" href="https://www.are.na/edouard-u/learning-gardens" target="_blank">join and assemble with us.</a><br /><br />

      These platforms were selected for being friendly to free initiatives, and with the exception of Slack, open for the public to view and modify.
