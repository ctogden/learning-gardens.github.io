      Learning Gardens is a meta-organization to support grassroots non-institutional learning, exploration, and community-building.<br><br>
      At its simplest, this means we want to help you start and run your own learning group. <br /><br />
      At its best, we hope you and your friends achieve nirvana.

      Organization<br><br>

      We currently use <a class="link dim green" href="https://learning-gardens.slack.com/" target="_blank">Slack</a> to communicate and <a class="link dim green" href="https://github.com/learning-gardens" target="_blank">Github</a> to build learning resources. We're avid users of <a class="link dim green" href="https://www.are.na/" target="_blank">Are.na</a>, which we use to find and collect research materials. In a way, Learning Gardens was born from this network. You're welcome to <a class="link dim green" href="https://www.are.na/edouard-u/learning-gardens" target="_blank">join and assemble with us.</a><br /><br />

      These platforms were selected for being friendly to free initiatives, and with the exception of Slack, open for the public to view and modify.
