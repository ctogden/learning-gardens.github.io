Hi, welcome to this place.

If you're reading this, you’re probably wondering where to start! Try sifting through some links on our site, especially our resources, <a class="link dim green" href="https://github.com/learning-gardens">Github Organization</a>, and <a class="link dim green" href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0By-mhwYd4hkhM2xEZG9iZ1p1QWc?usp=sharing">Google Drive</a>.

If you're tired of reading docs and this website in general, we’d highly recommend you <a class="link dim green" href="https://lg-slack-automate.herokuapp.com/">join our lively community in real time chat</a>. We're using Slack for this. It's great.

When you enter the chat, you’ll be dumped in a channel called <code>#_landing_pad</code>. This channel is muted by default so that any channels you join feel fully voluntary. 

We’ve recently started a system where we append any ”Learning Gardens”-related channels with an underscore (`_`), so it's easy to tell which channels are <em>meta</em> (e.g. `#_help`), and which are related to actual learning groups (e.g. `#cybernetics`).

Everything is up for revision.
