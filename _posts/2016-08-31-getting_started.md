<p>Hi, welcome to this place.</p>

<p>If you're reading this, you’re probably wondering where to start!</p>

<p>If you're tired of reading docs and this website in general, we’d highly recommend you <a class="link dim green" href="#">join our lively community in real time chat</a>. We're using Slack for this. It's great.</p>

<p>When you enter the chat, you’ll be dumped in a channel called <code>#_intros</code>. One of us will probably say “Hi!”, and you can talk about whatever you’d like in here.</p>

<p>We’ve recently started a system where we append any ”Learning Gardens”-related channels with an underscore, so it's easy to tell which channels are <em>meta</em>, and which are related to actual learning groups.</p>

<p>We’ll see if this system works in the long run.</p>
