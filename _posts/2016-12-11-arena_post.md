Learning Gardens was <a class="link dim green" href="https://www.are.na/blog/case%20study/2016/11/16/learning-gardens.html">featured on Are.na/blog</a> as the inaugural case study! 

The post tells some of our inception story and explains some of what we’re aiming for. You can also listen to us (Édouard & Lukas) talk about “what Learning Gardens is.” 

We’ve long loved Are.na’s approach to asynchronous, collaborative assemblage and seek to encourage many of the same patterns. Thanks for the publicity, guys.
