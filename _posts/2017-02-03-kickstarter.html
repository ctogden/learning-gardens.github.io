We launched <a class="link dim green" href=“https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/learningardens/learning-gardens-reader-launch”>our Kickstarter campaign</a> a week ago, but met our goal of $600 in a matter of hours. Since then, contributions have continued to roll in and we have gotten to work revising our copy, participants, and printers. We are also delighted to be a part of the Kickstarter <a class="link dim green" href=“https://www.kickstarter.com/discover/tags/make-100?ref=make100”>make100 campaign</a> (with <a class="link dim green" href=“https://www.kickstarter.com/discover/tags/make-100?ref=make100”>projects listed here</a>).
</p>
<p>
Firstly: thank you to all of our gardeners, friends, and associates who made this happen. We already knew there was something special about the LG community, and a roaring success for a fundraiser helps validate that.
</p>
<p>
Learning Gardens does not exist without our group leaders and everyone who shares, builds, and learns together. This organization is you—and you should be proud.
</p>
<p>
We have now had meetings with both <a class="link dim green" href=“https://www.publicationstudio.biz/”>Publication Studio</a> in LA and <a class="link dim green" href=“http://platplatformform.com”>Platform</a> in Chicago, discussing the form and logistics of our flagship reward: the Learning Gardens Reader. Platform, based in Chicago, will be our awesome printer for the project.
</p>
<p>
The Kickstarter money will firstly cover our pamphlet printing costs and other merchandise.
</p>
<p>
Everything else will go towards our Learning Gardens Microgrants program (exact name TBD), which will grant groups between $50 and $300 to fund organizational development, field trips, projects, and other activity within gardens that necessitates a budget. Our primary goal with the grants is to make learning group organization a more accessible activity to all.
</p>
<p>
As of writing, we have over $1000 in our campaign. As a stretch goal, if we can read $1400 by the end of our month, not only will the entire pamphlet be Risograph printed, but all contributors over $5 will receive a Learning Gardens pencil too.
</p>
<p>
