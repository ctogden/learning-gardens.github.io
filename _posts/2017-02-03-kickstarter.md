We launched [our Kickstarter campaign](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/learningardens/learning-gardens-reader-launch) almost a week ago, but met our goal of $600 in a matter of hours. 

Firstly: thank you, to all of our gardeners, friends, and associates who made this happen. We already knew there was something special about the LG community, and a roaring success for a fundraiser helps validate that. 

Learning Gardens does not exist without our group leaders and everyone who shares, builds, and learns together. This organization is youâ€”and you should be proud. 

We have had meetings with both [Publication Studio](https://www.publicationstudio.biz/) and [Platform](http://platplatformform.com/) in Chicago, discussing our flagship reward: the Learning Gardens Reader. Platform, based in Chicago, will be our printer for the project, and we are now collecting the pages from all of our participating gardens:

- Pixel-Lab (tended by Morgane Santos)
- Mondays (tended by Toby Shorin)
- Studio Studio (tended by Sam Panter)
- Pedagogy Play Lab (tended by Ryan Mather)
- Cybernetics Club (tended by Francis Tseng)
- APL Reading Group (tended by Lukas WinklerPrins, I guess)
- ***

The Kickstarter money will firstly cover our printing costs and other merchandise. 

Everything else will go towards our Learning Gardens Microgrants program (exact name TBD), which will grant groups between $50 and $300 to fund organization, field trips, projects, and other activity that necessitates a budget. Our primary goal with the grants is to make learning group organization a more accessible activity to all.
