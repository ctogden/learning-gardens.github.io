<h2>What is the Nursery Grants Program?</h2>

<p>The Learning Gardens Nursery Grants Program exists to financially support small projects that enact, advance, and/or celebrate decentralized and peer-led learning.</p>

<p>Learning Gardens distributes awards in the $50-$300 range. Amounts requested must correspond directly to purchases or hours recorded towards the project.</p>

<p>We're doing this for the first time and ironing out the kinks. For Nursery Grants vol. 1, the application period is April 1-30, 2017. Recipients will be determined by April 15th, and funds distributed immediately thereafter.</p>

<h2>Who is eligible for a Nursery Grant?</h2>

<p>Anyone. You do not need to be a part of Learning Gardens already (though we will require you to join our Slack!).</p>

<p>You do not need to have a background in this kind of stuff. We will ask for any previous work that can attest to your ability to follow-through on a project, though.</p>

<p>You can apply for a Nursery grant as an individual, as a team, or as an organization.</p>

<p>People of color, women, LGBTQ persons, people of low socioeconomic status, and those without a history of formal institutional support will receive first priority for Nursery Grants.</p>

<h2>Examples of Projects</h2>

<p>[ a couple speculative examples to represent the scope & type of projects we would like to see ]</p>

<h2>What We're Looking For</h2>

<p>We are looking for concrete, implementable projects with a finite timeline (i.e. you should be able to say "the project will be done at X date/time").</p>

<p>We are looking for projects that probe unexplored methodologies of teaching, sharing, and learning together.</p>

<p>We are looking for projects that address the nature of the world in 2017.</p>

<p>We are looking for projects that enhance existing projects, for projects that could lead to more, and for projects that start new things from scratch alike.</p>

<h2>What's Necessary to Apply</h2>

<ol>
<li>Pitch of project and its goals. (is it part of something larger? have you already started? what would successful implementation look like?)</li>
<li>Statement on why a Nursery Grant is appropriate. (how does your project resonate with Learning Gardens?)</li>
<li>Plan for implementation, with approximate timeline. (what steps will you take to implement, and when?)</li>
<li>Documentation Plan for project. (how will you record and share your progress?)</li>
<li>Budget spreadsheet with amount requested.</li>
<li>Usual Information</li>
</ol>
