        Learning Gardens is a meta-organization weaving networks of self-organized learning groups. <br /><br />
        At its simplest, this means we want to help you start and run your own learning group.<br /><br />
        At its best, we hope you and your friends achieve nirvana.<br /><br />

      Joining Learning Gardens is free and interest-driven. We encourage you to realize how much existing infrastructure for learning exists in the form of people, places, and resources.<br /><br />

      We are an internet-native organization. As such, we seek to embrace transparency, decentralization, and multiple access points.
