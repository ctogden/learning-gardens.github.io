      Learning Gardens is a meta-organization to support grassroots non-institutional learning, exploration, and community-building.<br><br>
      At its simplest, this means we want to help you start and run your own learning group. <br /><br />
      At its best, we hope you and your friends achieve nirvana.

      Our Mission<br /><br />

      It's difficult to carve out time for focused study. We support learning groups in any discipline to overcome this inertia and build their own lessons, community, and learning styles. <br> If we succeed in our mission, participating groups should feel empowered and free of institutional shackles.

      Community-based learning — free, with friends, using public resources — is simply a more sustainable and distributed form of learning for the 21st century. Peer-oriented and interest-driven study often fosters the best learning anyway.<br /><br />

      Learning Gardens is an internet-native organization. As such, we seek to embrace transparency, decentralization, and multiple access points.
