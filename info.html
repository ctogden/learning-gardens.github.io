            Our Purpose<br /><br />

            We are trying to construct a model of learning that is embedded in a community and driven by interest. We don’t want large institutions to be required—we want people to realize how much social infrastructure is around them for learning already in the form of people, places, and resources.<br /><br />

            You can read and edit our definition &amp; purpose <a class="link dim green" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/14zhjp8wFw_qpgEi7q8zJF7WmE_lAUKO99Gpg4w_NeHk/edit#" target="_blank">through this document</a>.

            Learning Gardens is...<br />
            ... a network of ideas, people, and resources,<br />
            ... built to encourage self-initiated community learning projects.<br />
            ... free to join and use.<br /><br />

            We see ourselves as a substrate in which many things can grow. <br /><br />

            Learning Gardens is an internet-native organization. As such, we seek to embrace transparency, decentralization, and multiple access points.
