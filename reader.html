title: Learning Gardens Reader ("Pamphlet")
headline: Early-2017 State of the Garden
---

<p>Published in March 2017 and printed by the wonderful <a href="http://platplatformform.com/">Platform</a>, the pamphlet is a collaboration between Lukas and Ã‰douard whose success depended on our entire organization. Inside has a statement on our goals, and an informative slip for each learning group.</p>

<p>We funded the pamphlet on <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/learningardens/learning-gardens-reader-launch">Kickstarter</a> and mobilized our network to far exceed our goals. Extra capital from the campaign and selling merchandise directly funds the <a href="http://learning-gardens.co/grants">Nursery Grants</a> program, supporting nascent experimental education projects.</p>
